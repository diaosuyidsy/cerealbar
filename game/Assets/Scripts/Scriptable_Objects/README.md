Scriptable objects are basically data containers that exist in editor and can be accessed and modified (and saved) during runtime. 
Unity has a good basic [intro](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/scriptable-objects) to it.
For this project I used them as basic databases for object holding of different types. For props we have an ObjectsDB and for materials (really only used for card generation) there is an array for Materials.
If you want to create another object database you simply create a new ObjectsDB and fill it up.
