## This is the Programming Language Tangent 


Currently the code supports:
- `WalkForward`
- `WalkBackward`
- `RotateLeft`
- `RotateRight`
- `Clear`
- for loop

Sample script:
``` 
for(3)
RotateRight
endfor
WalkBackward 
```

Cool feature: For object referencing, in code input mode, the player can click on an object on the map, and the name of the object is added to the code on the screen. This is implemented with booleans in mind for `Near`, but work on PL was stopped for more important things on the project
